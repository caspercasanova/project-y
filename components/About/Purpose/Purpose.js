          Our purpose is to unite the world through sport to create a
          healthy planet, active communities and an equal playing
          field for all.

        <p>
          We believe in the power of sport to unite and inspire people
          to take action in their communities. We work with grassroots
          organizations, partners and employees around the world to
          advance equality, level the playing field for all and make
          play and sport more approachable and accessible for kids.
          Because we know that active kids do better — in school, in
          their communities and in their future careers. And while all
          kids are made to play, not every kid gets the opportunity.

          Project Y exists to progress sport. But in recent years, we
          also face a broader challenge: to protect sport itself.”
