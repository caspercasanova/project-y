            Our purpose is to unite the world through sport to create
            a healthy planet, active communities and an equal playing
            field for all.

          <p>
            We believe in the power of sport to unite and inspire
            people to take action in their communities. We work with
            grassroots organizations, partners and employees around
            the world to advance equality, level the playing field for
            all and make play and sport more approachable and
            accessible for kids. Because we know that active kids do
            better — in school, in their communities and in their
            future careers. And while all kids are made to play, not
            every kid gets the opportunity.
