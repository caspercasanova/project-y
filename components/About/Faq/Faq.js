        'AN ITEM/SIZE IS OUT OF STOCK, WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE AGAIN?',
      answer:
        'We typically do not restock product once it sells out. It is rare if we do a restock, but if we do we only do it for a limited time. Our mailer will give updates for restocks and sizes before anyone else hears about it.',

        "When you place an order, we will send you an email with all the details including the name of the carrier, the ship date, and the tracking number. If you don't receive the email or have misplaced your tracking number, send us an email at contact@darcsport.com and we will be happy to resend it for you",
